# Matrix
 This is a simple matrix background in JS.

# Usage
 1. Put `src` folder to your project folder.
 2. Add this line to `<head>` tag in your `index.html` file.
 ```
 <script src="src/setup.js" type="module"></script>
 ```
 # Note
 If your src folder is not in the same directory as the `index.html`
 you need to change `path_to_stylesheet` in `config.js` in reference to `index.html`.
